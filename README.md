# About

**Regrown is a datapack inspired by Geophilic** which attempts to improve the default biomes of Minecraft by adding small, but notable additional features. It aims to add additional foliage to the rather bland default biomes, along with biome specfic unique features (*e.g. Mushrooms in regular Taiga's*). It also aims to support multiple Minecraft version, generally 1.18.2 or later (which was also a motivating factor!).

Check out the gallery for a glance at all the changes. ðŸŒ²

This is also my first dive into creating a datapack, if you suggestions, improvements, or generally want to poke around. Feel free to go right ahead, your right here at the github.

## Biomes
**As of version v1.0, it modifies the following biomes**:

*Heavy changes to:* Forest, Flower Forest, Birch Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest, Taiga, Plains, Sunflower Plains

*Small changes to:* Snowy Taiga, Savanna, Dark Oak Forest, Windswept Savanna, Windswept Forest

## Compatibility
This mod/datapack should work with anything else that does not modify the feature generation of the default biomes of Minecraft. Anything that changes the base generation will work fine, *e.g. Tectonic.* Yes, all mods that adds new biomes will work just fine.
