# About

Regrown is a datapack inspired by Geophilic which attemps to improve the default biomes of Minecraft by adding additional features. It increases the grass around most biomes, add overgrown (oak) trees, more flowers, patches, and more things. It targets and supports Minecraft 1.18.2 or later.

This is also my first attempt at creating a datapack, if you suggestions, improvements, or generally want to help me achieve something. Feel free to visit the github, it's completely open source!

## Biomes
As of version v1.0, it modifies the following biomes: Forest, Birch Forest, Taiga, Snowy Taiga, Plains, Savanna, Windswept Savanna, Windswept Forest
